Writing an interpreter for a basic C program

This program is provided with a test.c file to demonstrate a basic C program.

Compile main.c in terminal and run it, and it will run test.c by default, otherwise,
pass an argument of a .c file to run that.

This interpreter is able to execute expressions, local variables, variable expressions,
if and while statements, function calls (without parameters), and execute starting from main.

Symbol table is not completed for variables but is saved for functions.
